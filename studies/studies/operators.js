//OPERATORS:

//1.Assignment Operators:
/**
 * Assignment operators are used to assign a value to a variable. "=" assigns the value
 * of a variable.
 */

let x = 10; //assigns x to 10 using the let declaration
const pi = 3.14; //assigns pi to 3.14 using the const declaration
var c = 100; //assigns c to 100 using the var declartation
x = 11 //assigns x to 11
//

//2. Arithmetic Operators:
/**Arithmetic operators are used to perform simple mathmatical operations with numeric values.
 * Common arithmatic operators include +, -, /, *, and %, addition, subtraction, division,
 * multiplication, and the modulo, respectively.
 */ 

let a = 3 * 2;
console.log(a);
//this will print 6 to console because 3 multiplied by 2 is 6.

//Comparison Operators:

/**Comparison operators compare two values and return true or false. Common comparison operators
 * include ===, ==, !==, !=, >, <, >=, and <=, strictly equal, loosely equal, not strictly equal,
 * not loosely equal, greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to,
 * respectively. 
 */

console.log(5 < 10);
//this will print true to console because 5 is less than 10.
